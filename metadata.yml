name: 'TwinNet: Uncovering developmental time and tempo using deep learning'
description: During animal development, embryos undergo complex morphological changes
  over time. Differences in developmental tempo between species are emerging as major
  drivers of evolutionary novelty, but accurate description of these processes is
  a major challenge. To address this challenge, here we present an automated and unbiased
  deep learning approach to analyze the similarity between embryos of different time
  points. Calculation of similarities across stages resulted in complex phenotypic
  fingerprints, which carry characteristic information about developmental time and
  tempo. Using this approach, we were able to accurately stage embryos, detect naturally
  occurring and induced changes in the developmental progression of individual embryos,
  and derive staging atlases for multiple species de novo in an unsupervised manner.
  Our approach allows to objectively quantify developmental time and tempo and provides
  a standardized way to analyze early embryogenesis.
